# My First GitHub Repo ðŸš€

Hi! I'm learning how to use **Git** and **GitHub**, and this is my first pushed project.

In this repo, I'm revisiting **HTML** and **CSS** a years â€” just practicing, experimenting, and building small things to re-learn the basics.

## What's Inside
- Simple HTML pages
- Basic CSS styling
- A whole lot of curiosity

## Why This Exists
This project exists as part of my journey to:
- Understand Git/GitHub workflows
- Get comfortable with version control
- Brush up on web development

## What's Next
I'll be adding more files as I learn new things. Stay tuned! ðŸ™‚

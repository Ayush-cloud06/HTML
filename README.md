# My First GitHub Repo ðŸš€

Hi! I am learning how to use **Git** and **GitHub**, and this is my first pushed project.

In this repo, I'm revisiting **HTML** and **CSS** after years â€” just practicing, experimenting, to re-learn the basics.

## What's Inside
- Simple HTML pages
- Basic CSS styling
  

## Why This Exists
This project exists as part of my journey to:
- Understand Git/GitHub workflows
- Get comfortable with version control
- Brush up on web basics

## What's Next
I'll be adding more files as I learn new things. Stay tuned!
